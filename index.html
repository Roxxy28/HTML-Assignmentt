      If you've been struggling with work stress or things in your personal
      life, know that you're not alone. Many people need to take a break every
      now and then to focus on their mental health, destress, and come back to
      their responsibilities feeling recharged. Here are some key signs that you
      could benefit from taking some time to rest.

      A break may be in order if you're struggling to care about your work.
      Perhaps you are usually a very passionate employee, but lately, you can't
      muster the drive to finish your assignments. It's also possible that you
      no longer have an interest in signing on to more projects, collaborating
      with your coworkers, or speaking up in meetings. Taking a break from work
      can help you return with a newfound sense of energy and investment in your

      Notice if you've been losing things or leaving messes at your desk. This
      can also manifest in forgetting routine appointments, missing deadlines,
      and a general sense of forgetfulness. Taking a mental health break can
      help you return to your responsibilities with a clear head, which can
      really aid your organizational skills. Use your mental health break to
      rest and clear your head. Alternatively, take a break to get things in
      order again. Reschedule appointments you missed, write a to-do list, and
      mark important dates in your calendar.

      No matter how hard you try, you keep getting distracted. This could result
      in taking a long time to complete simple tasks or missing errors in your
      work that you normally would spot. Both indicate that you're in need of
      some time away to rest for the sake of your mental well being. Taking a
      break helps relax your mind or gives you some time to deal with what's
      been distracting you. That way, you can come back with a newfound

      Stress or burnout can make you see things more pessimistically. Notice if
      your outlook has been particularly glum lately. Other signs include
      negative self-talk and withdrawing from friends and family because you no
      longer trust them or enjoy their company. In addition to taking a break,
      try replacing negative thoughts with positive ones. If you catch yourself
      thinking, "I'm terrible at this" or "Nothing I do is good enough," replace
      those thoughts. Think something like, "I always try my best" or "Everyone
      makes mistakes."

      You might need time off if every little thing sets you off. Work
      frustrations can get to anyone sometimes, but reflect on if you've been
      frequently upset lately. Signs include resenting your colleagues, snapping
      at your partner or family at home, or simply struggling to be as kind as
      you usually are. These all point to being under an unmanageable amount of
      stress. Try not to beat yourself up about being snippy with your
      colleagues or family. Instead, practice self-compassion, take care of
      yourself and give yourself a break.

      You might be preoccupied with constant worries or fears. Take stock of how
      much your anxiety has been affecting your work.Perhaps you're unable to
      finish tasks due to how stressed you are about your workload. It's also
      possible that when you get home, you can't turn off your worries about
      work and enjoy yourself. These are both indicators that you need some rest
      for the sake of your mental health. You might be afraid to take a break if
      you have a lot of work, but it's actually helpful for your productivity in
      the long run.

      to keep from crying at work or school? Everyone struggles with this
      sometimes, but if this happens frequently you may be in need of a break.
      Work or school can amplify the emotions you're already feeling. A mental
      health day can help you get a clear picture of your emotions and what you
      need to feel better. Consider using a mental health day to schedule an
      appointment with a therapist or counselor. This can help you get a better
      understanding of what you're feeling and how to cope in a healthy way.
